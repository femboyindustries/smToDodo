# smToDodo
Converts .ssc/.sm files from Stepmania to Dodo Re Mi from Jackbox Party Pack 10.

## Download
Check out the releases tab to the right! You can either download an .exe version (for Windows), or you can download the Python script.

## Setup
Besides smToDodo, you need ffmpeg downloaded and added to the PATH enviroment variable of your system. <br>
Additionally, before using smToDodo for the first time, you need to set the song path in the config (see smToDodo.ini).

## Usage
Generally, you use it by typing `smToDodo [chart_path]` into your command prompt, where `[chart_path]` is either the folder of the simfile, or the .ssc/.sm file itself. <br>
It's also recommended to take a look at the help via `smToDodo -h`, as it contains extra options (most importantly basic hitsounding).
